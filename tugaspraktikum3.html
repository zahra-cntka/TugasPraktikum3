<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<pre>
<b>S</b>trawberries are sweet supple red fruits with surfaces that are seed
studded. They come from a low-growing plant belonging to genus
Fragaria of the rose (Rosaceae) family, enclosing white flowers, lobed foliage,
and runners. They origanate all through the north temperate zones.

They are the most famous and trendiest fruits in the planet (Roger).
There are over 600 assortments of strawberries that vary in taste, sixe,
and fell; all of which have similar trait; heart silhouette, red fleshy 
tissue with yellow seeds shooting the surface, petite, royal, leafy green 
lids, and stalk that embellish crowns (WHFoods). Below is picture of the 
strawberry fruit.</pre>

<h2 id="detailedhistory">Detailed history</h2>
<pre>The word strawberry is coined from 'strewn" berries about the plants and 
thus the "strewn berry" finally turned into "Strawberry" (Roger). They are 
not actual fruits or berries but distended ends of the stamen of the plant.
The seeds are on the external surface, rather than the internal berry. There
are around 200 seeds for each berry. They are low in calories and are non-flat,
loaded with vitamin c, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B6 and potassium (Roger).</pre>

<pre>Over the years they have been utilized as medications for ailments like,
stained teeth, sunburns, gouts and digestion (Hopey, 9). Strawberries were 
served up at medieval state occasions as a show of peace, wealth, and excellence.
The most well-known communal intake of strawberries is at Wimbledon annually, when
strawberries and cream are eaten by very well attired Englishmen in the middle of 
tennis games (Hopey, 9).</pre>

<h2 id="various">Various uses of strawberries</h2>
<pre>Strawberries have numerous uses. One of the most famous uses of strawberries
is being used as recipe or an ingredient in preparation of drinks, meals or snacks.
Strawberries are used as ingredients in many types of foods like cakes, yoghurt, 
desserts, salads, juice, meals and chocolates.
